# funky-webs README.md file
A website resume for all things funky.

This website is currently hosted at Heroku: 
		[funky-webs](https://funky-webs.herokuapp.com/)

The primary purpose of this site is to house both my personal short-form Resume, Curriculum Vitae, Blog and Projects that I'm working on. 

This site is a Python 3.6 Flask project built using

 - IntelliJ Idea SKD
 - Git / [GitHub](https://github.com/mfcummings/funky-webs)
 - Stackedit.io (synchronized editing of documentation)
 - Dropbox (cloud storage for development files)
 - Heroku (prototyping and deployment)
 - PostgreSQL

and likely other tools I'll be adding in the future.
